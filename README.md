This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Random Quote Generator

This is a project to show my understanding of 
  1.how to build front end development libraries using react
  1.how to compile, push, and bug fix that app to host on github
  1.and how to utilize fetching and promises in a react redux framework without breaking it. (that last one was a doozy)
